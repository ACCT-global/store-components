# Greeting
Greeting is a canonical component that any VTEX app can import.

To import it into your code: 
```js
import Greeting from 'vtex.store-components/Greeting'
```

## Usage
You can use it in your code like a React component with the jsx tag: `<Greeting />`. 

Greeting will render a welcome message with the user first name if that is available on orderForm.
